# About Hayabusa

Hayabusa is a **Windows event log fast forensics timeline generator** and **threat hunting tool** created by the [Yamato Security](https://yamatosecurity.connpass.com/) group in Japan. Hayabusa means ["peregrine falcon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_falcon") in Japanese and was chosen as peregrine falcons are the fastest animal in the world, great at hunting and highly trainable. It is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and supports multi-threading in order to be as fast as possible. We have provided a [tool](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa/tree/main/tools/sigmac) to convert [sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) rules into hayabusa rule format. The hayabusa detection rules, like sigma, are also written in YML in order to be as easily customizable and extensible as possible. It can be run either on running systems for live analysis or by gathering logs from multiple systems for offline analysis. (At the moment, it does not support real-time alerting or periodic scans.) The output will be consolidated into a single CSV timeline for easy analysis in Excel or [Timeline Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md).

## Main goals

### Threat hunting

Hayabusa currently has over 1000 sigma rules and around 50 hayabusa rules with more rules being added regularly. The ultimate goal is to be able to push out hayabusa agents to all Windows endpoints after an incident or for periodic threat hunting and have them alert back to a central server.

### Fast forensics timeline generation

Windows event log analysis has traditionally been a very long and tedious process because Windows event logs are 1) in a data format that is hard to analyze and 2) the majority of data is noise and not useful for investigations. Hayabusa's main goal is to extract out only useful data and present it in an easy-to-read format that is usable not only by professionally trained analysts but any Windows system administrator.
Hayabusa is not intended to be a replacement for tools like [Evtx Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) or [Event Log Explorer](https://eventlogxp.com/) for more deep-dive analysis but is intended for letting analysts get 80% of their work done in 20% of the time. 

# About the development

First inspired by the [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) Windows event log analyzer, we started in 2020 porting it over to Rust for the [RustyBlue](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/RustyBlue) project, then created sigma-like flexible detection signatures written in YML, and then added a backend to sigma to support converting sigma rules into our hayabusa rule format.

## Testing hayabusa out on sample evtx files

We have provided some sample evtx files for you to test hayabusa and/or create new rules at [https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-sample-evtx](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-sample-evtx)

You can download the sample evtx files to a new `hayabusa-sample-evtx` sub-directory with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-sample-evtx.git
```

> Note: You need to run the binary from the Hayabusa root directory. 

# Usage

> Note: You need to run the Hayabusa binary from the Hayabusa root directory. Example: `.\hayabusa.exe`

## Caution: Output printed to screen may stop in Windows Terminal

As of Feb 1, 2022, Windows Terminal will freeze midway when displaying results to the screen when run against the sample evtx files.
This is because there is a control code (0x9D) in the output.
This is known Windows Terminal bug which will eventually be fixed but for the meantime, you can avoid this bug by adding the `-c` (colored output) option when you run hayabusa.

## Usage examples

* Run hayabusa against one Windows event log file:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -f eventlog.evtx
```

* Run hayabusa against the sample-evtx directory with multiple Windows event log files:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx
```

* Export to a single CSV file for further analysis with excel or timeline explorer:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -o results.csv
```

* Only run hayabusa rules (the default is to run all the rules in `-r .\rules`):

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -r .\rules\hayabusa -o results.csv
```

* Only run hayabusa rules for logs that are enabled by default on Windows:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -r .\rules\hayabusa\default -o results.csv
```

* Only run hayabusa rules for sysmon logs:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -r .\rules\hayabusa\sysmon -o results.csv
```

* Only run sigma rules:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -r .\rules\sigma -o results.csv
```

* Enable deprecated rules (those with `status` marked as `deprecated`) and noisy rules (those whose rule ID is listed in `.\config\noisy-rules.txt`):

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx --enable-noisy-rules --enable-deprecated-rules -o results.csv
```

* Only run rules to analyze logons and output in the UTC timezone:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -r .\rules\hayabusa\default\events\Security\Logons -u -o results.csv
```

* Run on a live Windows machine (requires Administrator privileges) and only detect alerts (potentially malicious behavior):

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs -m low
```

* Get event ID statistics:

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -f Security.evtx -s
```

* Print verbose information (useful for determining which files take long to process, parsing errors, etc...):

```bash
.\hayabusa.exe -d .\hayabusa-sample-evtx -v
```

* Verbose output example:

```bash

* Quiet error mode:
By default, hayabusa will save error messages to error log files.
If you do not want to save error messages, please add `-Q`.

# Hayabusa output

When Hayabusa output is being displayed to the screen (the default), it will display the following information:

* `Timestamp`: Default is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.sss +hh:mm` format. This comes from the `<Event><System><TimeCreated SystemTime>` field in the event log. The default timezone will be the local timezone but you can change the timezone to UTC with the `--utc` option.
* `Computer`: This comes from the `<Event><System><Computer>` field in the event log.
* `Event ID`: This comes from the `<Event><System><EventID>` field in the event log.
* `Level`: This comes from the `level` field in the YML detection rule. (`informational`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) By default, all level alerts will be displayed but you can set the minimum level with `-m`. For example, you can set `-m high`) in order to only scan for and display high and critical alerts.
* `Title`: This comes from the `title` field in the YML detection rule.
* `Details`: This comes from the `details` field in the YML detection rule, however, only Hayabusa rules have this field. This field gives extra information about the alert or event and can extract useful data from the `<Event><System><EventData>` portion of the log. For example, usernames, command line information, process information, etc...

When saving to a CSV file an additional two fields will be added:

* `Rule Path`: The path to the detection rule that generated the alert or event.
* `File Path`: The path to the evtx file that caused the alert or event.

## Progress bar

The progress bar will only work with multiple evtx files.
It will display in real time the number and percent of evtx files that it has finished analyzing.

## Color Output

You can output the alerts in color based on the alert `level` by specifying `-c` or `--color`.
You can change the default colors in the config file at `.\config\level_color.txt` in the format of `level,(RGB 6-digit ColorHex)`.
Note: Color can only be displayed in terminals that support [True Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_(24-bit)).
Example: [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for macOS.

# Hayabusa rules

Hayabusa detection rules are written in a sigma-like YML format and are located in the `rules` folder. In the future, we plan to host the rules at [https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-rules](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-rules) so please send any issues and pull requests for rules there instead of the main hayabusa repository.

Please read [AboutRuleCreation-English.md](./doc/AboutRuleCreation-English.md) to understand about the rule format how to create rules.

All of the rules from the hayabusa-rules repository should be placed in the `rules` folder.
`informational` level rules are considered `events`, while anything with a `level` of `low` and higher are considered `alerts`.

The hayabusa rule directory structure is separated into 3 directories:

* `default`: logs that are turned on in Windows by default.
* `non-default`: logs that need to be turned on through group policy, security baselines, etc...
* `sysmon`: logs that are generated by [sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
* `testing`: a temporary directory to put rules that you are currently testing

Rules are further seperated into directories by log type (Example: Security, System, etc...) and are named in the following format: 

* Alert format: `<EventID>_<MITRE ATT&CK Name>_<Description>.yml`
* Alert example: `1102_IndicatorRemovalOnHost-ClearWindowsEventLogs_SecurityLogCleared.yml`
* Event format: `<EventID>_<Description>.yml`
* Event example: `4776_NTLM-LogonToLocalAccount.yml`

Please check out the current rules to use as a template in creating new ones or for checking the detection logic.

## Hayabusa v.s. converted Sigma rules

Sigma rules need to first be converted to hayabusa rule format explained [here](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa/blob/main/tools/sigmac/README-English.md). Hayabusa rules are designed solely for Windows event log analysis and have the following benefits:

1. An extra `details` field to display additional information taken from only the useful fields in the log.
2. They are all tested against sample logs and are known to work. 
   > Some sigma rules may not work as intended due to bugs in the conversion process, unsupported features, or differences in implementation (such as in regular expressions).

**Limitations**: To our knowledge, hayabusa provides the greatest support for sigma rules out of any open source Windows event log analysis tool, however, there are still rules that are not supported:

1. Rules that use regular expressions that do not work with the [Rust regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/)
2. Aggregation expressions besides `count` in the [sigma rule specification](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/wiki/Specification).

> Note: the limitation is in the sigma rule converter and not in hayabusa itself.

## Detection rule tuning

Like firewalls and IDSes, any signature-based tool will require some tuning to fit your environment so you may need to permanently or temporarily exclude certain rules.

You can add a rule ID (Example: `4fe151c2-ecf9-4fae-95ae-b88ec9c2fca6`) to `config/exclude-rules.txt` in order to ignore any rule that you do not need or cannot be used.

You can also add a rule ID to `config/noisy-rules.txt` in order to ignore the rule by default but still be able to use the rule with the `-n` or `--enable-noisy-rules` option.

## Event ID filtering

You can filter on event IDs by placing event ID numbers in `config/target_eventids.txt`.
This will increase performance so it is recommended if you only need to search for certain IDs.

We have provided a sample ID filter list at [`config/target_eventids_sample.txt`](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa/blob/main/config/target_eventids_sample.txt) created from the `EventID` fields in all of the rules as well as IDs seen in actual results.

Please use this list if you want the best performance but be aware that there is a slight possibility for missing events (false negatives).

## Comparison to other similar tools that support sigma

Please understand that it is not possible to do a perfect comparison as results will differ based on the target sample data, command-line options, rule tuning, etc...
In our tests, we have found hayabusa to support the largest number of sigma rules out of all the tools while still maintaining very fast speeds and does not require a great amount of memory. 

The following benchmarks were taken on a Lenovo P51 based on approximately 500 evtx files (130MB) from our [sample-evtx repository](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa-sample-evtx) at 2021/12/23 with Hayabusa version 1.0.0.

|           | Elapsed Time |                         Memory Usage                         | Unique Sigma Rules With Detections |
| :-------: | :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Chainsaw  | 7.5 seconds  |                            75 MB                             |                170                 |
| Hayabusa  | 7.8 seconds  |                            340 MB                            |                267                 |
| Zircolite |  34 seconds  | 380 MB (normally requires 3 times the size of the log files) |                237                 |

* With hayabusa rules enabled, it will detect around 300 unique alerts and events. 
* When tested on many event logs files totaling 7.5 GB, it finished in under 7 minutes and used around 1 GB of memory. The amount of memory consumed is based on the size of the results, not on the size of the target evtx files.
* It is the only tool that provides a consolidated single CSV timeline to analysis in tools like [Timeline Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md).
