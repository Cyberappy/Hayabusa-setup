**New Features:**
- Specify config directory (`-C / --config`): When specifying a different rules directory, the rules config directory will still be the default `rules/config`, so this option is useful when you want to test rules and their config files in a different directory. (@hitenkoku) 
- `|equalsfield` aggregator: In order to write rules that compare if two fields are equal or not. (@hach1yon)
- Pivot keyword list generator feature (`-p / --pivot-keywords-list`): Will generate a list of keywords to grep for to quickly identify compromised machines, suspicious usernames, files, etc... (@kazuminn)
- `-F / --full-data` option: Will output all field information in addition to the fields defined in the ruleâ€™s `details`. (@hach1yon)
- `--level-tuning` option: You can tune the risk `level` in hayabusa and sigma rules to your environment. (@itib and @hitenkoku)

- 32-bit Hayabusa Windows binaries are now prevented from running on 64-bit Windows as it would cause unexpected results. (@hitenkoku)
- MITRE ATT&CK tag output can be customized in `output_tag.txt`. (@hitenkoku)
